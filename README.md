A **Clean**, **Robust** Template for Foundry Projects.

## Getting Started

Click [`use this template`](https://github.com/abigger87/femplate/generate) to create a new repository with this repo as the initial state.

Or, if your repo already exists, run:
```sh
forge init --template https://github.com/abigger87/femplate
git submodule update --init --recursive
forge install
```

## Creating a new test

I don't want to have to think about avoiding contract naming collision, so each new test file
is prefixed with a number, and all the contract names in that file have that same number as a suffix.

There's now a script to generate a new file with a contract and empty test function. Just run the following replacing `<test_name>` with the name of your test (file naming conventions apply, avoid spaces).  Or omit the test name to invoke _interactive mode_.

```sh
./newTest.sh <test name>
```

## Yul code

Occasionally it's helpful to generate the Yul intermediate representation to understand what's
happening underneath the hood. In that case, I'll just use a command like the following to
put the IR into the `./ir` dir. Using a `.sol` extension gives pretty decent syntax highlighting
for readability.

```
forge inspect Target16 ir >! ir/bytesArgLenCheck16.yul.sol
```

Yul code can be compiled with `solc --strict-assembly`.

## Blueprint

└─ Greeter.t — Exhaustive Tests
```


## Development

**Setup**
